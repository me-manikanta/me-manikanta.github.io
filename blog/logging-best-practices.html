But when I became a backend developer, I realised the importance of logging. In this blog, I am listing down all the things that I&#x27;ve learned in the past few years and the rules I follow when writing log statements.</p><h2>What exactly is logging?</h2><p>In laymen&#x27;s terms, we all know what logging is; it&#x27;s printing messages, variables and exceptions to the console or a file. It is partially correct. However, what I feel is logging is a mechanism to record the state of the application and the actions it has taken at a given point in time.</p><p>If we think about it, both definitions are completely different. One suggests that we are indicating where we are in the codebase, and the second indicates the current state of request flow. This change in the thought process when developing an application helps us to write better logging statements and, in turn, helps us to improve the application.</p><h2>Different levels of Logs</h2><p>The level of logging may vary based on the team you&#x27;re in, the application you&#x27;re working on, and, most likely, the framework/language you&#x27;re using. The most widely used logging levels are <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>WARN</code> and <code>ERROR</code>.</p><h3>DEBUG üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649343223530/meiZpkf88.gif" alt="debugging.gif"/></p><p>As the name suggests, these logs contain information that is most interesting for developers when trying to debug a problem. They are fine-grained statements concerning the state of the application.</p><p>In our production system, we have a huge number of <code>DEBUG</code> logs, and we tend to disable this level mostly. We enable this only when the need arises.</p><h3>INFO ‚ÑπÔ∏è</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649343014674/dCycagJ2a.gif" alt="info-level.gif"/> <!-- -->Logs at this level are purely informational messages, as the name suggests and¬†they should not be used to indicate a fault or error state in the application.

These logs give us some heads-up, indicating something that might need our attention.</p><h3>ERROR üö®</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649342866161/BKZSWVpCu.gif" alt="error.gif"/></p><p>Logs at this level contain failures in the application.

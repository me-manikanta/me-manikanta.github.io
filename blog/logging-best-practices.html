But when I became a backend developer, I realised the importance of logging. In this blog, I am listing down all the things that I&#x27;ve learned in the past few years and the rules I follow when writing log statements.</p><h2>What exactly is logging?</h2><p>In laymen&#x27;s terms, we all know what logging is; it&#x27;s printing messages, variables and exceptions to the console or a file.

One suggests that we are indicating where we are in the codebase, and the second indicates the current state of request flow. This change in the thought process when developing an application helps us to write better logging statements and, in turn, helps us to improve the application.</p><h2>Different levels of Logs</h2><p>The level of logging may vary based on the team you&#x27;re in, the application you&#x27;re working on, and, most likely, the framework/language you&#x27;re using.
